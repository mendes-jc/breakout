## breakout

Hello Ritz Deli engineers!

First, thank you for the opportunity to be part of the process :)

I tried to make the game a bit modular by adding the possibility to configure brick types with specific colors and score values.

Additionally, most of the gameplay elements, including ball speed, the chance of specific bricks appearing, brick matrix size, etc., can be configured through the Controller object.

I'm looking forward to hearing from you!
